## Overview

During my role as a Service Desk Technician at The Salvation Army, I played a key role in improving the IT operations by implementing Single Sign-On (SSO) for over 5,000 users and automating critical workflows using ServiceNow. The goal was to enhance the end-user experience, reduce IT support load, and streamline the process of resolving incidents.

## Key Features

- **Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration**: Successfully integrated SSO for over 5,000 users, simplifying the login process and reducing the number of support tickets related to password issues.
- **ServiceNow Automation**: Automated IT service workflows using ServiceNow, including incident management, request fulfillment, and change management.
- **Improved Support Metrics**: Reduced average ticket resolution time by 20%, increasing user satisfaction.

## Technologies Used

- **ServiceNow**: For managing IT service workflows and automating support processes.
- **OneLogin**: For managing user authentication and implementing SSO.
- **PowerShell**: For scripting and automating administrative tasks.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the key challenges was ensuring that the SSO integration did not disrupt the existing authentication workflows for legacy systems. This required thorough testing and coordination with the infrastructure team to ensure a smooth rollout. Additionally, automating workflows using ServiceNow required close attention to detail to ensure that each process was streamlined without introducing new inefficiencies.

## Outcome

The project led to a significant reduction in the IT support workload, saving over 10 hours of IT staff time per week. It also improved the overall user experience by reducing login-related issues and expediting the resolution of incidents and requests.
